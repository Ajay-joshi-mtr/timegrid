**The problem**

Small and medium scale businesses wish to provide online service booking for their customers, but the tools out there are either *too expensive* or *too complex* for their needs.

**The Solution**

Timegrid is a single platform holding all *businesses* and *customers* while letting them an *affordable* and *easy to use* way to interact. Like a **CRM**, but *Simple*, *Useful*, and *Fast*.

Built with the [**Laravel 5.1 (LTS)**](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1) framework for [**PHP**](http://php.net/).

> For the build under upgraded **Laravel 5.2** refer to the `4.0-beta-1` branch.
